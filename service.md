Each pod have IP address assigned. When new pod is created then new ip is assigned 	to them. <br>
So here service comes into the picture,<br>
Like, <br>
assign permenant IP address to Pod.<br>
Also helps in load balancing.<br>

Internet ---> Service ---> Pod1-Pod2-Pod3 <br>

Each service has its own end points from where they can be accessed from internet.


Get list of services:
```
kubectl get svc
```

Types of services:
1. ClusterIP
2. NodePort
3. LoadBalancer
4. ExternalName
5. Headless

## 1.ClusterIP 		

Expose an application of cluster to other parts of cluster.<br>
Allows internal Applications communication with each other.<br>
It Assigns a uniq range of IP address from the clusters address 	range.<br>


Not Externally Accessible.<br>

Internal load balancer between pods.<br>

ClusterIP is default service. If we did not define Type in yaml 	then it will take default service.

YAML file: clusterip.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
name: nginxsvc
spec:
  selector: 
    app: nginx
  type: ClusterIP
    ports: 
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
```

Create service:
```
Kubectl apply -f clusterip.yaml
```

## 2.NodePort :

Node IP + Port <br>

- External service
- Expose app running in kubernetes cluster to outside world, using static port on each node.


How it works ?<br>
Pod - where your app runs<br>
ClusterIP - load balancer between pods<br>
NodePort - opens port on each node so you can access the app from outside.<br>


Sample: deployment.yaml
```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: nginx  # example app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80

Service : Nodeportservice.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80         # service port (internal)
      targetPort: 80   # pod port
      nodePort: 30080  # external port (between 30000â€“32767)
```

Apply:
```BASH
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

List services from all namespaces:
```
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces
```
