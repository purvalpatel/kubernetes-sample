Ingress controller is used whenever you want to **expose HTTP/HTTPS** service running inside your clusder to the outside world. <br>

**Calico** alone doest not expose HTTP services. it provides networking between pods only. <br>

To expose HTTP/HTTPs using ingress you need to install:
1. NGINX ingress
2. Traefik
3. HAProxy ingress
4. Istio gateway
5. Kong

If you have installed Nginx as a reverse proxy on your host machine and with this you are routing ports of pod. then only it will work. <br>
```
Client -> NodeIP:NodePort -> Kube-Proxy -> Calico -> Pod
```
Here, No ingress is involved.
Nothing wrong with this approach. This is best for small deployments.

### Limitations: 
❌ You must manually edit NGINX config for every new app <br>
❌ Certificates (HTTPS) must be managed manually <br>
❌ If pods restart → NodePort changes? You must reconfigure <br>
❌ No path-based or host-based routing automatically <br>
❌ No automatic health checks <br>
❌ No autoscaling integration <br>
❌ High maintenance when apps grow <br>
❌ Multiple domains = multiple NGINX config blocks <br>
❌ No dynamic updates without reloads <br>
❌ Load balancing must be done manually <br>

If you expose app with **domain name** then you must installed Ingress controller.

**For Production grade deployment Nginx Ingress is recommended.** <br>

### Why Kubernetes Recommended Ingress controller ? 
✔ Fully automatic routing <br>
✔ Dynamic updates <br>
✔ Host-based & path-based routing <br>
✔ Built-in HTTPS + Cert-Manager <br>
✔ No manual reverse proxy needed <br>
✔ Works with autoscaling <br>
✔ Load balancing <br>
✔ Annotations for advanced features <br>
✔ Better traffic performance <br>

So Why use NGIN
