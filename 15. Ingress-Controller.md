Ingress controller is used whenever you want to **expose HTTP/HTTPS** service running inside your clusder to the outside world. <br>

**Calico** alone doest not expose HTTP services. it provides networking between pods only. <br>

To expose HTTP/HTTPs using ingress you need to install:
1. NGINX ingress
2. Traefik
3. HAProxy ingress
4. Istio gateway
5. Kong

If you have installed Nginx as a reverse proxy on your host machine and with this you are routing ports of pod. then only it will work. <br>
```
Client -> NodeIP:NodePort -> Kube-Proxy -> Calico -> Pod
```
Here, No ingress is involved.
Nothing wrong with this approach. This is best for small deployments.

### Limitations: 
❌ You must manually edit NGINX config for every new app <br>
❌ Certificates (HTTPS) must be managed manually <br>
❌ If pods restart → NodePort changes? You must reconfigure <br>
❌ No path-based or host-based routing automatically <br>
❌ No automatic health checks <br>
❌ No autoscaling integration <br>
❌ High maintenance when apps grow <br>
❌ Multiple domains = multiple NGINX config blocks <br>
❌ No dynamic updates without reloads <br>
❌ Load balancing must be done manually <br>

If you expose app with **domain name** then you must installed Ingress controller.

**For Production grade deployment Nginx Ingress is recommended.** <br>

### Why Kubernetes Recommended Ingress controller ? 
Kubernetes environment is dynamic, Your manual reverse proxy breaks when scaling.

✔ Fully automatic routing <br>
✔ Dynamic updates <br>
✔ Host-based & path-based routing <br>
✔ Built-in HTTPS + Cert-Manager <br>
✔ No manual reverse proxy needed <br>
✔ Works with autoscaling <br>
✔ Load balancing <br>
✔ Annotations for advanced features <br>
✔ Better traffic performance <br>

- Seats inside the kubernetes cluster and reads ingres objects.

**If we setup Nginx Ingress we dont require Nginx reverse proxy which is installed on host server.**

## Deployment:

1. Create Deployment:

deployment.yaml
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: demo
        image: hashicorp/http-echo
        args:
        - "-text=Hello from Ingress!"
```

2. Create service:
demo-service.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: demo-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: demo-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 5678

```
Apply both:
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f demo-service.yaml
```

3. Create ingress controller for your domain:
ingress-controller.yaml
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: demo-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: demo.yourdomain.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: demo-service    ## here this controller is linked with the service name
            port:
              number: 80
```
### ☑ If you want HTTPS (Let’s Encrypt)

Install cert manager:
```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
```
Create clusterissuer:
```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    email: your-email@example.com
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: le-prod-key
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```
Then modify ingress to add TLS:
```
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - demo.yourdomain.com
    secretName: demo-tls

```
apply:
```
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```
Flow:
```
Client -> Nginx Ingress Controller -> K8s service -> Pod
```

**Nginx Ingress is retriring in March 2026.** <br>
Gateway API is taking over.
